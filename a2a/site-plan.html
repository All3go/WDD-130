      <p>
        Welcome to the Universe Page!
        This page explores the vastness of space through the lens of astronomy, the scientific study of stars, planets, and everything beyond Earth. One of the most fascinating aspects of the universe is its scale, which can sometimes be confusing—many people mix up galaxies and solar systems! Here, you'll take a journey from the smallest scale, starting with a person on Earth, all the way to the observable universe. Each step along the way includes an image and a lesson to help you grasp just how immense our cosmic home truly is. Get ready to explore the universe like never before!

      <h3>Constellations Page</h3>
      <p>
        Astrology is a practice based on the belief that the positions of celestial bodies influence human traits, emotions, and destinies. The twelve zodiac constellations, through which the Sun appears to move throughout the year, form the foundation of Western astrology. Many believe that each zodiac sign is associated with specific personality traits, strengths, and challenges, shaped by the elements (fire, earth, air, and water) and planetary rulers. For example, Aries, a fire sign ruled by Mars, is often seen as bold and energetic, while Pisces, a water sign ruled by Neptune, is thought to be intuitive and compassionate. Whether you view astrology as a guiding force or simply an intriguing tradition, exploring how the stars have shaped beliefs about personality can be both fun and thought-provoking.
