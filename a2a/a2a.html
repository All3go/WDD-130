      Welcome to the Universe Page! This page explores the vastness of space through the lens of astronomy, the scientific study of stars, planets, and everything beyond Earth. One of the most fascinating aspects of the universe is its scale, which can sometimes be confusingâ€”many people mix up galaxies and solar systems! Here, you'll take a journey from the smallest scale, starting with a person on Earth, all the way to the observable universe. Each step along the way includes an image and a lesson to help you grasp just how immense our cosmic home truly is. Get ready to explore the universe like never before!
