        <h3>Earth</h3>
        <p>Earth, our home planet, is the only known place in the universe that supports life as we know it. With a diameter of about 7,918 miles, Earth is just the right size for sustaining its ecosystems, water cycles, and climate. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of approximately 93 million miles, a distance that allows it to maintain temperatures conducive to life. Earth’s atmosphere is a delicate balance that shields us from harmful radiation while allowing us to breathe the oxygen needed for survival. In the vast expanse of space, Earth is but a tiny speck, yet it is the only world we know that nurtures life.</p>

        <h3>The Moon</h3>
        <p>The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is about 2,159 miles in diameter, roughly one-fourth the size of Earth. Positioned about 238,855 miles away from Earth, it exerts a gravitational pull that affects tides and stabilizes the tilt of our planet. It’s believed to have formed around 4.5 billion years ago from a massive collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body. While the Moon is much smaller than Earth, its proximity to our planet makes it a significant presence in our sky. Its barren, cratered surface tells the story of billions of years of cosmic history.</p>

        <h3>Jupiter</h3>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 86,881 miles, making it more than 11 times the size of Earth. Located approximately 484 million miles from the Sun, it is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has a mass that is over 300 times greater than Earth's and a strong magnetic field that is over 14 times stronger than Earth's. Its Great Red Spot, a massive storm, has been raging for at least 350 years, and it could easily fit three Earths inside it. With more than 79 moons, Jupiter's influence extends far beyond its own massive body, controlling the orbits of many smaller objects in the solar system.</p>

        <h3>The Sun</h3>
        <p>The Sun, a massive ball of hot gas, is the central star of our solar system. It has a diameter of about 864,000 miles, more than 109 times the size of Earth. Located approximately 93 million miles from Earth, the Sun provides the heat and energy that sustains life on our planet. Its energy is produced through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms are converted into helium, releasing an immense amount of energy. The Sun's outer layer, known as the corona, can reach temperatures of up to 2 million degrees Fahrenheit, while the core reaches temperatures of around 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. The Sun's size and energy output are simply staggering, making it the lifeblood of our solar system.</p>

        <h3>The Solar System</h3>
        <p>The Solar System consists of the Sun and all the objects that are gravitationally bound to it. These include eight planets, dwarf planets, moons, comets, asteroids, and more. The system spans an enormous distance, with the farthest planet, Neptune, orbiting about 2.7 billion miles from the Sun. The entire Solar System stretches across a distance of more than 287 billion miles, with the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud extending far beyond. Traveling at the speed of light, it would take over four hours to reach the edge of the Solar System. It is difficult to comprehend the true vastness of our solar neighborhood, yet it is only a small part of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

        <h3>The Milky Way Galaxy</h3>
        <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, home to our solar system. It has an estimated diameter of 100,000 light-years. To put that in perspective, a light-year is the distance that light travels in one year, approximately 5.88 trillion miles. Our galaxy is composed of over 100 billion stars, many of which have their own planets and moons. The Milky Way is just one of billions of galaxies in the universe, yet it is the only one we can truly call home. Despite its vast size, we are located on one of its spiral arms, a small section within a universe so large it is almost beyond understanding.</p>

        <h3>The Neighborhood Galaxy Cluster</h3>
        <p>The Local Group is a collection of more than 50 galaxies, including the Milky Way, Andromeda, and the Triangulum Galaxy. It spans a distance of about 10 million light-years, with the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies on a collision course in about 4.5 billion years. Within this cluster, galaxies are gravitationally bound together, moving through space as one large system. The size of the Local Group seems massive, but it is just a tiny fraction of the universe, a mere speck in the grand cosmos.</p>

        <h3>The Laniakia Super Cluster</h3>
        <p>The Laniakea Supercluster is one of the largest known structures in the universe, spanning an astonishing 520 million light-years across. It contains approximately 100,000 galaxies. Laniakea is not just a random collection of galaxies; interconnected network of galaxies bound together by gravity. The supercluster's name, Laniakea, comes from the Hawaiian language, meaning "immense heaven," reflecting its vast size and significance.
          It is the region of the universe where the Milky Way belongs. In comparison to the universe, Laniakea is just one of many superclusters scattered across the cosmos. This red dot shows where the Milky Way galaxy is located within Laniakea.</p>

        <h3>The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall</h3>
        <p>The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall is the largest known structure in the observable universe. It stretches across an astounding 10 billion light-years. This superstructure is a massive collection of galaxies bound together by gravity, forming a vast wall-like formation in the universe. The size of this structure is difficult to comprehend, as it is larger than anything within our immediate cosmic neighborhood. It represents the scale of the universe in a way that is almost unimaginable, showing the incredible expanses of space that go far beyond the limits of our own solar system and galaxy.</p>
